## Repo Description


## Abstract
Discrediting misinformation has shown itselfto be a challenging approach in combating thedissemination of yellow journalism.  Nudgingreaders in the direction of better sources of in-formation has been an alternative explored inthe data science field.   Given how successfulbiased headlines are in drawing engagement,we explore hyper partisan title generation as analternative to common approaches - that relyon  informing  bias  levels  -  in  combating  thespread of misinformation.

## Data
**Data for PAN at SemEval 2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection (Version Training and validation v1) [Data set]**. Johannes Kiesel, Maria Mestre, Rishabh Shukla, Emmanuel Vincent, David Corney, Payam Adineh, … Martin Potthast ***2018*** [[Dataset]](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1489920)

The dataset is labeled by the overall bias of the publisher according to publisher bias lists compiled by BuzzFeed news and Media Bias Fact Check. It is a balanced dataset containing 750,000 articles with headlines, half of which (375,000) are hyperpartisan and half are not. Among the hyperpartisan articles, half(187,500) are biased on the left side of the political spectrum, and the other half are on the right.
