and frequently inadvertently,^ with a variety of approaches^ to growth. unfortunately, many of these strategies have turned out to have built in limitations^ or decelerators^ – what one might call elements of unsustainability.^ and avoiding^ serious damage and difficult recoveries^ requires us to get a lot better at recognizing^ these self limiting^ growth patterns^ early on. here are some of the items in a growing library^ of decelerating^ growth models.^ in developing countries, import substitution^ as a way to jump start economic diversification^ can work for a while;^ but, over time, as productivity^ growth lags^ and comparative^ advantage is over ridden,^ growth grinds^ to a halt.^ small,^ open economies are naturally^ somewhat specialized,^ which leaves them vulnerable to shocks^ and volatility.^ but, in terms of growth and living standards,^ the cost of economic diversification,^ when implemented^ by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition,^ eventually outweighs^ the benefits.^ it is better to allow specialization,^ and build effective social safety nets^ and support systems to protect people and families during economic transitions.^ such “structural^ flexibility”^ is better adapted^ to enabling^ the broad changes that rapidly evolving^ technological^ and global economic forces require.^ mismanagement^ of natural resource wealth underpins^ an especially potent^ self limiting^ pattern of growth and development. if invested in infrastructure,^ education, and external financial assets,^ natural resource revenues can accelerate^ growth. but, too often,^ such revenues distort^ economic incentives,^ which come to favor rent^ seeking and interfere^ with the diversification^ that is essential for growth. more recently, many advanced countries have discovered a “new”^ set of growth models with built in structural^ limitations:^ excessive^ private or public consumption,^ or both,^ usually accompanied^ and enabled^ by rising debt and inflated^ asset prices, and a corresponding^ decline in investment.^ this approach appears to work until domestic aggregate^ demand can no longer sustain^ growth and employment,^ at which point it ends in either gradual^ stagnation^ or a violent financial and economic crisis. (in fact, many developing countries have learned this the hard way, but the lessons seem not to have crossed^ over to advanced countries.)^ but the opposite of the excessive^ consumption model – excessive^ reliance on investment to generate aggregate^ demand – is also a self limiting^ growth pattern.^ when the private and social returns of investment diminish^ too much,^ growth cannot be sustained indefinitely,^ even though rising investment rates can sustain^ aggregate^ demand for a while.^ altering^ this growth pattern is a significant part of the challenge that china now faces.^ rising inequality in either opportunity or outcomes^ (and often both)^ also poses^ threats to the sustainability^ of growth patterns.^ while people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market determined income variation,^ based on differential^ talents^ and personal preferences,^ there are limits.^ when they are breached,^ the typical result is a sense of unfairness,^ followed by resistance and, ultimately,^ political choices that address the inequality,^ though sometimes in counter productive,^ growth impeding^ ways.^ perhaps the largest long run sustainability^ issue concerns the adequacy^ of the global economy’s^ natural resource base:^ output will more than triple^ over the coming two or three decades, as high growth developing economies’^ four billion people converge^ toward advanced country income levels and consumption patterns.^ existing economic development strategies will require significant adaption^ to accommodate^ this kind of growth. some adaptation^ will occur naturally,^ as rising energy and other commodity^ prices generate incentives^ to economize^ or seek alternatives.^ but the un priced^ environmental externalities^ – global warming and water depletion,^ for example – will require serious attention,^ not myopic,^ reactive^ mindsets^ and approaches.^ all of these self limiting^ growth patterns^ tend to have three things in common.^ first, in one or several dimensions,^ some part of the economy’s^ base of tangible,^ intangible,^ and natural resource assets is being run down. i would include social cohesion^ as part of the asset base:^ it is the one that is depreciated^ by excessive^ inequality.^ measurement^ issues play an important role here. it is easier to run down something that is partly invisible^ because it is not regularly or effectively measured.^ expanded measurement^ of the dimensions^ of economic,^ social,^ and environmental performance is necessary to broaden^ awareness of sustainability^ issues. second, unidentified^ self limiting^ growth patterns^ produce very bad results. expectations come to exceed^ reality,^ and resetting^ the system to a sustainable growth pattern is difficult.^ after all, past investment shortfalls^ have to be made up and future oriented^ investments undertaken^ simultaneously^ – a double burden that must be borne^ by the current generation.^ an inability^ to resolve the distributional^ and fairness^ problem can produce gridlock,^ paralysis,^ and prolonged^ stagnation.^ finally, many of these flawed^ growth patterns^ involve fiscal distress.^ contrary^ to the prevailing^ wisdom^ nowadays,^ some degree of keynesian^ demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring^ fiscal balance over a sensible^ time period. on the contrary,^ applied both individually^ and together, fiscal stimulus and consolidation^ are necessary parts of the adjustment^ process. but they are not sufficient.^ the crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible^ aggregate^ demand and restoration^ of those parts of the economy’s^ asset base that have been run down, implying^ the need for structural^

overwhelming that college graduates^ have lower unemployment rates,^ earn far more money, and are generally healthier^ and happier^ than those with a high school education or less.^ and young people seem persuaded.^ college enrollment^ rates for high school grads^ have risen from numberplaceholder percent in numberplaceholder to nearly numberplaceholder percent last year. peter thiel,^ the billionaire co founder of paypal,^ disagrees.^ and his willingness to spend millions of his own fortune^ to pay bright young people to drop out and start businesses earned him a national audience sunday night on numberplaceholder minutes,^ the country's most watched news program. my first reaction was to agree with entrepreneur^ scholar^ vivek^ wadhwa,^ who has lambasted^ thiel^ for selling young people on the fantasy^ of hitting the entrepreneurial^ jackpot^ without an advanced education. “if you don't even have a bachelor's^ degree,^ if you don't even have basic education, basically you are beyond hope,”^ wadhwa^ told cbs.^ after listening to thiel’s^ argument,^ however, i think he has a point. while he's utterly^ wrong on the virtues^ of dropping out (the fortunate^ few like mark zuckerman^ excepted),^ he's right that the compact^ between what college promises and what society is delivering^ is increasingly frayed.^ here's what the deal is supposed to be:^ parents sacrifice^ to help their kids through college because that is the surest^ road to advancement.^ but over the past two decades, the road has become a lot bumpier.^ numbers compiled^ earlier this month by the economic policy institute (epi)^ show that the hourly^ wage of recent college graduates,^ after rising sharply at the end of the numberplaceholders, has fallen back. starting wages for college grads^ today are only slightly higher than in numberplaceholder or just under $numberplaceholder an hour in numberplaceholder dollars.^ unemployment is near numberplaceholder percent and underemployment^ nearly numberplaceholder percent. and new graduates^ are entering the job market with much greater debt burdens.^ as tuition^ continues to rise,^ two thirds of students are borrowing^ to earn bachelor's^ degrees,^ up from numberplaceholder percent in the early numberplaceholders. wadhwa^ rightly^ points out that the average debt load^ on graduation^ $numberplaceholder – is not excessive,^ but that may only begin to count the costs. a washington post piece tuesday, provocatively^ titled \"is^ college too easy?\"^ noted that the time students spend studying^ has dropped steadily^ over the years. but the main reason seems to be that more and more students are holding down part time jobs to finance their education, reducing the time available for classwork.^ in short, students are paying more, borrowing^ more, and getting less.^ thiel's^ response to these trends is to give up on higher education and encourage young people to take up plumbing^ or roll the dice^ on launching a business. that's the wrong response.^ if the epi^ numbers for recent college grads^ are depressing,^ the picture for those with less education is positively^ dickensian.^ recent high school grads^ entering the workforce^ have an unemployment rate over numberplaceholder percent and an underemployment^ rate over numberplaceholder percent, and those lucky enough to find jobs are earning less than $numberplaceholder an hour.^ as i know from playing the board game life's^ twists^ and turnswith^ my kids,^ with some luck^ you can make it big as an actor or an athlete.^ but the odds of winning the game go way up with a college degree.^ neither am i persuaded,^ however, that the right response is just to rally around the colleges^ as they are currently doing business. sure, the elite institutions can keep raising tuition,^ confident that student demand far exceeds^ supply,^ the brand value of a harvard or stanford^ justifies^ the expense,^ and their large endowments^ will open doors for some who would otherwise be turned away. but state universities cannot play their traditional role as ladders^ of opportunity if funding continues to be slashed.^ california, which has the nation’s flagship^ public system, has seen state funding cut precipitously;^ it is now at the same level as numberplaceholder numberplaceholder when there were numberplaceholder fewer students. and both state schools and smaller private colleges^ need to get creative at doing more with less.^ this could include expanded online learning,^ greater specialization^ (not^ every school can and should be offering the full range of courses^ in all subjects)^ and new faculty hiring models that mix superstar^ professors^ with hands on instructors.^ there are some fascinating^ initiatives under way, though the biggest ones such as edx^ and mitx^ are led by the elite universities.^ peter thiel^ clearly struck a chord^ when he said on numberplaceholder minutes that college education is a “bubble.”^ too many young people&#numberplaceholder;^ are overpaying^ for a product whose returns are increasingly uncertain.^ but the product is one that both individuals and american

at native american establishments,^ such as foxwoods,^ and designated^ racinos^ like the aqueduct^ racetrack^ in the borough^ of queens.^ cuomo,^ like many politicians pushing similar proposals,^ trumpeted^ the move as a victory for local economic development, \"this is a process that will ultimately put thousands of new yorkers^ to work, drive our economy, and help keep billions of dollars spent by new yorkers^ on gaming^ in the state,\"^ he said. but many economists say such claims are contingent^ on a number of factors and come with several often understated^ offsets^ and costs. casinos^ often \"cannibalize\"^ other forms of spending that contribute to state coffers^ (including^ other forms of gambling,^ like the lottery)^ and can divert^ money from more productive^ economic activity.^ for instance, money lost at the blackjack^ table could just as easily have been spent on a consumer good or other form of entertainment.^ it could also simply have been saved for

regressive^ tax (nyt)^ that takes money from the same citizens who can least afford it. warren buffett^ has referred to gambling^ as a “tax^ on ignorance.”^ some,^ of course, may gamble^ away money that would have otherwise been spent on food or housing.^ analysts encourage policymakers^ to know their local market before opening the doors to any new gambling^ facilities.^ a top international city like new york may stand to attract new gambling^ dollars from foreign tourists^ as well as capture revenues from locals^ that currently head across the border to niagara^ falls or atlantic city. but a state like kentucky,^ which is also looking at legalizing^ casinos,^ may not be so lucky.^ while kentucky casinos^ may keep local gamblers^ from fleeing^ across the ohio river to the craps^ tables^ in indiana,^ they're unlikely to establish a gambling^ \"destination\"^ in the state. as more and more states legalize^ casinos,^ a zero sum paradigm^ begins to emerge.^ states and localities^

decade, keeping out tourists,^ students, and business travelers^ and driving away foreign investment?^ i testified yesterday to the house judiciary^ committee’s^ subcommittee^ on immigration enforcement,^ which was considering h.r.^ numberplaceholder the “welcoming^ business travelers^ and tourists^ to america act”^ introduced by republican congressman joe heck^ (r nv).^ the legislation is one of more than half a dozen bills introduced this session to deal with visa^ problems. action by congress is needed on a package of measures,^ and i explained why in my testimony to the committee. but positive progress continues to be opposed by those who see any effort to facilitate^ travel to the united states as inevitably^ weakening^ security, despite abundant^ evidence that, as i put it in my testimony,^ “efficiency^ and security can go hand in hand, and the united states does not need to harm its economy to safeguard^ its borders.”^ i was particularly dismayed^ by the testimony of janice^ kephart,^ who was one of the co authors of the numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder commission’s^ superb^ staff report numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder and terrorist travel.^ that report was extremely valuable to me when i wrote my book the closing of the american border,^ and remains the best single source available on the many mistakes^ made in visa^ procedures^ that allowed the numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder hijackers^ to obtain permission^ to travel to the united states. but ms. kephart,^ who now works for the center for immigration studies,^ used her testimony to claim that the numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder commission was somehow opposed to efficient visa^ processing,^ and that h.r.^ numberplaceholder which is a very modest effort designed to facilitate^ travel,^ would violate^ the commission’s^ recommendations.^ but a careful reading of either the staff report she worked on or the best selling numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder commission reportmakes^ it clear that this is specious.^ the commissioners^ were acutely^ aware that, while visa^ security needed to be improved,^ it must be done in a way that did not drive away foreign visitors.^ to quote from p.^ numberplaceholder of the numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder commission's^ report:^ that last sentence is perhaps the most important.^ there have been tremendous improvements^ in visa^ security over the past decade, and the steep^ declines^ in visa^ travel that occurred in the years after numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder are gradually^ being reversed.^ but it is an evolving^ challenge.^ there is no question that al qaeda,^ despite its weaknesses,^ continues to look for new ways to attack the united states. the recent revelations^ that al qaeda had developed a more sophisticated^ underwear^ bomb are only the latest evidence.^ the united states must continue to develop and improve its travel and border security systems.^ but, as the numberplaceholder/numberplaceholder commission understood,^ we do ourselves no favors^ by shutting^ out friends in order to keep away foes.^ hopefully^ congress is finally getting that message as
